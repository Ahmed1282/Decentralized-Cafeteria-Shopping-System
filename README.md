# Decentralized Cafeteria Shopping System

## Introduction
Welcome to the Decentralized Cafeteria Shopping System, a pioneering DAPP (Decentralized Application). This project strives to transform cafeteria interactions, utilizing blockchain for efficient meal ordering, secure transactions, and a rewarding system.

## Project Overview
Our system connects university management, cafeteria staff, and users in a seamless, blockchain-powered environment. It enhances the cafeteria experience through efficient order processing, cryptocurrency payments, and a loyalty program.

### Features
- **Menu Management**: Enables cafeteria staff to update the menu, adjust prices, and manage item availability.
- **Order Processing**: Users can easily select, order, and customize their meals.
- **FastCoin Payments**: Transactions are made using FastCoin, our custom ERC20 token.
- **Loyalty Rewards**: A rewarding system that benefits regular customers.
- **Promotions**: Dynamic discounts and special offers.

### Technology Stack
- **Smart Contracts**: Developed on the Ethereum blockchain using Solidity.
- **Front-End**: Implemented with JavaScript and the React framework.
- **Tokenomics**: FastCoin, following the ERC20 token standard.
